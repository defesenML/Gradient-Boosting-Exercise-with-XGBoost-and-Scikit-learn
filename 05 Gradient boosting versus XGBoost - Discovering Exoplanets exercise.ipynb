    "The general idea behind boosting algorithms is to transform weak learners into strong learners. A weak learner is hardly better than random guessing. But there is a purpose behind the weak start. Building on this general idea, boosting works by focusing on iterative error correction, not by establishing a strong baseline model. If the base model is too strong, the learning process is necessarily limited, thereby undermining the general strategy behind boosting models.\n",
